Conway's Game of life
 
A bare bones NET 6 implementation implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
 
This version contain two Rulesets.  The first Ruleset is the standard Conway rules for Life.  The second Ruleset modifies Conway's rules by biasing the death of cells.  Even a small bias leads to growth much like that observed in Bacteria.  This version also permits the alteration of the starting density.
